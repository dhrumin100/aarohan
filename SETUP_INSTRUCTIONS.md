# Setup Instructions for Form Submission

## Current Status
✅ **Navigation Issues Fixed**: All navigation buttons now work properly
✅ **Modal Issues Fixed**: Contact forms and floor plan modals now open correctly
✅ **Form Submission Working**: Forms submit successfully and redirect to thank you page

## Backend Setup Required

The form submission currently works but data is not being saved to Google Sheets because the environment variables are not configured.

### Step 1: Create Environment File
Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with these variables:

```env
# Google Sheets Configuration
GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=your_actual_sheet_id_here
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_BASE64=your_base64_encoded_service_account_key_here
```

### Step 2: Get Google Sheet ID
1. Create a Google Sheet
2. Copy the ID from the URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/SHEET_ID_HERE/edit`
3. Replace `your_actual_sheet_id_here` with your actual sheet ID

### Step 3: Get Service Account Key
1. Follow the instructions in `GOOGLE_SHEETS_SETUP.md`
2. Download your service account key JSON file
3. Encode it to base64:
   ```bash
   cat service-account-key.json | base64
   ```
4. Copy the base64 output and replace `your_base64_encoded_service_account_key_here`

### Step 4: Test
1. Restart your development server
2. Submit a form
3. Check the browser console and server logs for confirmation
4. Check your Google Sheet for new data
